### 2. GraphRAG vs Traditional RAG

**Traditional RAG Limitations**:
- **Flat, unstructured context**: Linear text appending without relational understanding
- **Limited multi-hop reasoning**: Difficulty connecting disparate information pieces
- **Token limit constraints**: Risk of exceeding limits with verbose, unfiltered content
- **Opaque reasoning**: Black-box decision making with poor traceability

**GraphRAG Advantages**:
- **Enhanced contextual understanding**: Structured relationships mirror human reasoning
- **Multi-hop reasoning capabilities**: Can traverse complex relationship chains
- **Improved accuracy**: 30% better performance in comprehensive datasets
- **Better explainability**: Clear reasoning paths through graph traversal
- **Efficient token usage**: Focused retrieval reduces noise and redundancy

**Performance Metrics** (GraphRAG vs Baseline RAG):
- **Comprehensiveness**: Higher detail coverage across all question aspects
- **Diversity**: More varied perspectives and insights
- **Empowerment**: Better user understanding and informed decision-making
- **Directness**: More specific and clear question addressing

### 3. Implementation Approaches

#### Microsoft GraphRAG
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Advanced entity recognition and relation extraction
- **Semantic Clustering**: Groups related information for better organization
